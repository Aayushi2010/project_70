        <p>Yonsei University (Korean: 연세대학교; Hanja: 延世大學校; [jʌn.se.dɛ.hak.k͈jo]) is a private research university in Seoul, South Korea. As a member of the “SKY” universities, Yonsei University is deemed as one of the three most prestigious institutions in the country. It is particularly respected in the studies of medicine and business administration.

            The student body consists of 26,731 undergraduate students, 11,994 graduate students, 4,518 faculty members, 6,788 staff, and 257,931 alumni. Yonsei operates its main campus in Seoul and offers graduate, postgraduate and doctoral programs in Korean and English.

            The university was established in January 1957 through the union of Yonhi College (연희전문학교; 延禧專門學校) and Severance Union Medical College (세브란스 의과대학; 세브란스 醫科大學). This was a result of a lasting bilateral cooperation between the colleges that began in the 1920s. The institutions were the first of their kinds in Korea. Yonhi College was one of the first modern colleges, founded as Chosun Christian College (조선기독교대학; 朝鮮基督教大學) in March 1915. Severance has its roots in the first modern medical center in Korea, Gwanghyewon (광혜원 廣惠院, House of Extended Grace), founded in April, 1885. As a tribute, the name "Yonsei" was derived from the first syllables of the names of its two parent institutions, "Yon; 연; 延" from Yonhi College and "Sei; 세; 世" from Severance Union Medical College.Yonesi University was also used as a film place for a Netflix series that is called "Extra ordinary you" which is a part of the K-drama (Korean Drama) series.</p>

In the April of 2000, this library initiated a digital library project and launched the XML based Digital Library, XMDL, in 2001. Launching the YOURS+, the Integrated Information Retrieval System, and the “Lecture YOURS+ and Research Support System”, PLATON, were also involved in this project. In 2005, the E-resource management system, YERM was launched for more systemized e-resources management.</p>

            I am not exaggerating here but every dish offered by the cafeteria tastes better than any of the dishes from Korean restaurants in Australia. Side dishes change every day, cafeteria even updates its menu every now and then. It also has cook-yourself machine for you to boil your own instant noodle – how cool is that!</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As you spend your third year at Yonsei as a junior, it is not an exaggeration to claim that university life somehow becomes a repetitive routine. You find yourself taking for granted the same old campus and buildings for your daily classes. You reach a point when you can distinguish the mind frame of the staff at the school café just by taking a sip of the same iced Americano that you have been drinking every day for the past few semesters. 
            However, this seemingly unchangeable routine began its drastic transition as the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in South Korea on January 20, 2020, which was met with a series of unprecedented precautionary measures. All campus buildings were restricted to one designated entrance with thermal imaging cameras and thermometer guns monitoring all entrants. Strict opening hours were set, and even the historic 24-hour study rooms in the Central Library have shortened opening hours. </p>
